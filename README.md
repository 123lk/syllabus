This is the syllabus and course material for [Code Your Future](http://codeyourfuture.co/), a
not-for-profit volunteer-run coding school for refugees and asylum seekers.

During the course you will learn a technology stack that helps you build anything from a simple website to a powerful database-driven web application or even a mobile app!

The six-months course contains:
- HTML/CSS
- Core JavaScript
- Backend development using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
- Modern front-end development with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)

Weâ€™ll complement the training with workshops on modern software methodologies and job interview practices, etc.
