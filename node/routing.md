# Using Express.Router
We have lots of Routes in **server.js**, we can use the express.Router class to create modular, mountable route handlers. A Router instance is a complete middleware and routing system; for this reason, it is often referred to as a “mini-app”.

> **Exercise**: Use `express.Router` to organise the routes in **server.js** in a more *modular* fashion. Write your new file under `/routes/site-routes.js`.
