## Homework
1. Watch all of the videos in Wes Bos's ES6 course.

2. If you finish that you can move on to [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/), another course by WesBos. In this course you'll build something in JavaScript every day, which means lots of cool projects!

3. Work through this quiz: [Scope quiz](http://madebyknight.com/javascript-scope/)

4. Next week we'll be moving on to more advanced JavaScript. The key to becoming a good developer is constant practice. Practice your JavaScript basics by signing up for [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) and try to do a couple of exercises every day.

5. Read the Wikipedia article about [Test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)

6. Solve the exercises in this repo (using TDD) https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/js-tdd-exercises
