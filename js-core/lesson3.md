1. Watch `Scope` and `Closure` section of the [Deep JavaScript Foundations](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-foundations/)

2. Work through this quiz: [Scope quiz](http://madebyknight.com/javascript-scope/)

3. Next week we'll be moving on to more advanced JavaScript. The key to becoming a good developer is constant practice. Practice your JavaScript basics by signing up for [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) and try to do a couple of exercises every day.

4. Watch Wes Bos's [ES6 course](https://es6.io/) (Ask in slack if you do not have an invitation)

5. Read the [Test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) Wikipedia article

6. (Optional) If you finish that you can move on to [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/), another course by WesBos. In this course you'll build something in JavaScript every day, which means lots of cool projects!
