## Comments

You can put comments to help you and others understand your code - use `//` to add a comment (or if it is a multi-line comment, then use `/*` and `*/` around your comment)
```js
// This is a comment for myself and other developers to understand the next line of code
console.log('Hello world!');

console.log('Hello World'); // comments can also be in the same line like this
/*
I can also make comments
over more than one line if necessary
*/
console.log('Hello World');
```
