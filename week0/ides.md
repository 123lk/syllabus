## IDE

IDE stands for "Integrated Development Environment". It is the software that you will
be using to write most of your code. It is designed to help you develop your apps
quickly, focusing on the problems that you need to solve instead of having to search
Google for minor details.

### Auto-complete

One of the most important features of an IDE is that it provides "auto-completion".
This means that it will give you suggestions of what you can can write next, while
you are typing something.

For example, when writing a CSS property, it will tell you what values you can assign
it to.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img
    src="assets/lesson-0/ide-auto-complete.png"
    width="300"
    alt="IDE - Auto complete"
  />
</div>

### File tree view

The reason why we call it "Integrated" is that you almost don't need to leave the
window to write your app. For example, creating, renaming and moving files can be
done directly from the IDE. This functionality can be achieved from something called
a "Tree view", which you can usually find on the left side of your IDE.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img
    src="assets/lesson-0/file-tree.png"
    width="200"
    alt="IDE - File tree"
  />
</div>

### Finding files

When working with big projects, you will often need to find a file quickly, without
having to go through the tree view manually.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img
    src="assets/lesson-0/find-file.gif"
    width="500"
    alt="IDE - Find file"
  />
</div>

Most IDEs will allow you to do this with a sequence of keys.

VSCode sequence: **Windows/Linux** Ctrl + P | **Mac** Cmd + P

### Install an IDE

For this course, we recommend the usage of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Please
go ahead and install it, then try opening an HTML file with it via File > Open.
