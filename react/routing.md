Routing
----
React can be used as a `Single Page Application`, i.e. providing full experience of an application with many views within one page with several components.

However it is still possible to support `routing` by associating and displaying different components for different URLs.

Routing is usually achieved in React with a library such as `React Router`. You can find more information about this library with examples [here](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router).
