## CodeYourFuture

- Who we are?
- What we learn?
  - Read this Technology Survey from [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/insights/survey/2017). Pay particular attention to the technologies we'll be teaching you (JavaScript, React, NodeJS)
- [House Rules](house-rules.md)
  - How we work?
  - How we treat each other?
- Standup

## Welcome!

Welcome to CodeYourFuture and to the world of Web Development! Now that you have built
a website in CodePen and learned the basics of HTML and CSS, it's time to learn about
the tools that web developers use in their everyday job. These tools will be used during
the course, so it is important that you become familiarised with them.

In order to get started, we would like you to try to complete a task at home: move your
CodePen website to a web address under `https://your-username.github.io/your-site-name`.

In the process, you will learn how to store your code outside CodePen's website, in a location
where other developers can make changes to it and view a history of all the updates that
you have made.

If you wish to learn more about the concepts behind the steps we are suggesting below,
please read the rest of this document.

And remember: it's ok if you are stuck and don't know how to continue. At any point, please
ask for a mentor's help. We will cover these steps again in the lesson, and will explain
them in more detail.

### How to move your website to Github.io
1. Export your website as a zip from CodePen. [Help >](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/features/exporting-pens/)
2. Extract the contents of the zip file to a folder in your computer. Keep note of the
location of this folder.
4. Read about the [terminal](#terminal-basics).
5. Read about [git](#git).
6. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/).
7. Put the contents of the zip folder in a Gitub repository. [How does Github work? (30min) >](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8TXME3bzNs)
8. You should now have a page with your code under `http://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name`.
This is a view of your code, and you should see a list of your files, including an `index.html`.
9. Now all that remains is to publish your website! Still under `http://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name`,
find the settings icon in the top right corner.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img
    src="assets/lesson-0/repo-settings.png"
    width="200"
    alt="Repo settings"
  />
</div>

10. Find the section named "Github Pages" and select "master branch" in source, then hit
"Save".

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img
    src="assets/lesson-0/repo-settings-pages.png"
    width="200"
    alt="Repo settings - Github pages"
  />
</div>

11. Wait a few minutes, then refresh the page and come back to the Github Pages section.
You should see a green bar saying "Your site is published at `http://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name`".
Click the link, verify that your website is there, then share it with your CYF class!

## Terminal basics

During your course journey and onwards, the **terminal** (also known as **command line**)
will be one of your most valuable tools. It will help you to interact with you computer
faster, by helping you to:

- Create and delete files.
- Install web development tools.
- Start a server.
- Use source control (explained [later in this lesson](#Git)).

All this will make sense as we progress with the lessons. For now, we would like you
to get familiar with it by following this tutorial:

- [Learn the command line >](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)

### How do I use it on my computer?

So now that you know what the terminal can do for you, how do you use it? Please find
instructions for your operating system below. After you have followed the instructions,
open a terminal and write `ls`, then press the `Enter` key. You will see something
like this:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img
    src="assets/lesson-0/terminal.png"
    width="300"
    alt="Terminal"
  />
</div>

#### Linux

The Terminal is already installed. It should be in the list of applications available in
your computer. [More instructions >](http://www.wikihow.com/Open-a-Terminal-Window-in-Ubuntu)

#### macOS (Apple)

The Terminal is already installed. It should be in the list of applications available in
your computer. [More instructions >](http://www.wikihow.com/Get-to-the-Command-Line-on-a-Mac)

#### Windows

Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/). It will bring with it a tool called "Git Bash".
When the mentors ask you to open a terminal or command line, please open "Git Bash".


## Homework

- If you have not yet moved your website from CodePen to Github, do it now. Please use the
information in this section to complete it.
- When your website is live at `https://your-username.github.io/your-site-name`, please send
a link to the slack channel of your class.
- Learn how to navigate your computer using a Terminal (view files, copy files).
- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Open your website with VS Code and add something to it: text, images, update CSS.
Commit your changes to Github and verify that `https://your-username.github.io/your-site-name`
has been updated!

It's alright if you are getting stuck or if something doesn't look right!
When it happens, please ask your mentors or classmates for help in Slack.
