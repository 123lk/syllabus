ES6
---
ES6 is a new standard for Javascript (ECMAScript). It is already supported in many browsers (check compatibility [here](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/)).

Some useful features:

- Let / Const
- Classes
- Export Modules / Importing
- Arrow functions / scope

Some features and their ES5 compatible code can be found [here](http://es6-features.org/)
