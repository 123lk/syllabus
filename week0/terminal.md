# Terminal basics

During your course journey and onwards, the **terminal** (also known as **command line**)
will be one of your most valuable tools. It will help you to interact with you computer
faster, by helping you to:

- Create and delete files.
- Install web development tools.
- Start a server.
- Use source control (explained [later in this lesson](#Git)).

All this will make sense as we progress with the lessons. For now, we would like you
to get familiar with it by following this tutorial:

### How do I use it on my computer?

So now that you know what the terminal can do for you, how do you use it? Please find
instructions for your operating system below. After you have followed the instructions,
open a terminal and write `ls`, then press the `Enter` key. You will see something
like this:

<div style="text-align: center;">

    width="300"
    alt="Terminal"
  />
</div>

#### Linux

The Terminal is already installed. It should be in the list of applications available in

#### macOS (Apple)

The Terminal is already installed. It should be in the list of applications available in

Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/). It will bring with it a tool called "Git Bash".
When the mentors ask you to open a terminal or command line, please open "Git Bash".
