# CSS Selectors

During your application process, you became familiar with CSS selectors. We'll review the basic selectors and then practice combining these to modify our button styles.

If you want to review the selectors, read the [Common Selectors section](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/complex-selectors/) of this page.

**Exercise (pair programming):** Continue working in pairs and use the [background properties](http://www.htmldog.com/references/css/properties/background/) to add a [assets/jumbotron-background.jpg](background image) to the jumbotron and change the colour of the text to white.
Change the colour of the buttons and add a hover state.

**Exercise (stretch goal):** research css transitions and make the background colour fade in.
