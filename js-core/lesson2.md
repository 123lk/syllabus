## Content:
 - [Arrays](./arrays.md)
 - [Objects](./objects.md)


## Homework
1. [The repo](https://github.com/Code-Your-Future/JS-Core-1-Exercises) that you have forked during the last class contains few challenges - solve them all in JavaScript. You should know all the needed information by now.

2. Complete [the Khan Academy course](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming) if you haven't already. It will go through some of the basics that we covered in the class and beyond.

3. Complete the [Codecademy Learn JavaScript Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript) if you haven't already. 

4. **Research:**

  Read these chapters from [JS: The Good parts](https://github.com/iteles/Javascript-the-Good-Parts-notes):

    - Chapter 9: Style - it's a short chapter, everyone start by reading that chapter.
    - ALL: Read the chapter about **Objects** (up to Reference)
    - Read the chapter about **Arrays**
    - Read the chapter about **Functions** up to the section about **Return**

  Alternatively you can watch week4 of [HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers) tutorial. Highly recommended.

5. Read this page on [Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes), a new feature in JavaScript introduced in ES6.

  When reading always try the code snippets by yourself in Node. (change document.writeln to console.log)

  - Read this article on [Pair Programming](https://medium.com/@dickeyxxx/how-to-pair-program-d6741077e513)

  - Read this page on [Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes), a new feature in JavaScript introduced in ES6.

  (Optional) Create an account on [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) and begin working through the exercises.

  Next class - we want you to do a presentation (including showing some code sample) for one of these concepts:

  - Switch Statements and Ternary Operators
  - Math methods in JavaScript
  - While loops (compare them to for Loops)
  - Array.slice and Array.splice
  - Array.map and Array.forEach
  - Array.find and Array.filter
  - Object classes.
  - ES6.
  - String.replace, String.search and other String methods
  - Object.keys (How to loop the properties of an object)
  - [Function arguments](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments)
  - [Advanced] [Different ways of Creating objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects#Creating_new_objects)
  - [Advanced] [Inheritance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects#Inheritance)
  - [Advanced] [Regular Expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions)
