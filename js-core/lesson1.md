## Homework

- [The repo](https://github.com/Code-Your-Future/JS-Core-1-Exercises) that you have forked during this class contains few challenges - solve them in JavaScript!
    - We will spilt the groups in to pairs
    - Use Slack's screen-sharing functionality to pair-programme at least once before Wednesday
    - Create a PR by the end of Wednesday
    - Code review your pair-partner's PR by creating at least one comment

- Create a programme using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) 
    - Sign up for an account
    - Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/52JoFF4HMA4?autoplay=1&rel=0) to help you get up to speed with how to use it
    - Create your own project with these 3 rules. Your project should: 
        - have at least two sprites, at least one of which must resemble something other than a cat
        - have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite)
        - use at least one if/else condition, one loop, and one variable
    - Once you've created your project, share the project on Slack so others can play around with it!

- Try and solve these [more advanced JS challenges](https://gist.github.com/40thieves/d649104a5d836937995795a1a512df14)!

- Follow [this course](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming) on Khan Academy. It will go through some of the basics that we covered in the class and beyond.
