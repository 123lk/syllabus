## Homework
1. [The repo](https://github.com/Code-Your-Future/JS-Core-1-Exercises) that you have forked during the last class contains few challenges - solve them all in JavaScript. You should know all the needed information by now.

2. Complete [the Khan Academy course](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming) if you haven't already. It will go through some of the basics that we covered in the class and beyond.

3. Complete the [Codecademy Learn JavaScript Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript) if you haven't already.

4. Alternatively you can watch week4 of [HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers) tutorial. Highly recommended.

5. Read this page on [Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes), a new feature in JavaScript introduced in ES6.
